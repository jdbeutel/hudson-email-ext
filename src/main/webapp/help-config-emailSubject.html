	Customize the subject line of the email notification.
  	The plugin can replace certain symbols in the subject and body fields of the email
  	so that you can include special information from the build.  If you leave this blank,
  	the default email subject-line, configured in the system configuration, will be used.
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li>
  		<i>$DEFAULT_SUBJECT</i> - Inserts the default subject line from the system configuration
  		page.  You can put anything you want before or after this section and it will be sent as 
  		well.  If you leave the subject field blank, this will be inserted by default.
  	</li>
	<li>
		<i>$HUDSON_URL</i> - Inserts a url pointing to Hudson's dashboard.  This must be 
		configured on the system configuration page.  All other URLs are relative to this
